## Introduction

The data for this model include 2D images of the occlusal (chewing) upper first and second molar surfaces of three different extinct species of horse. The images were taken using a portable lightbox setup and Nikon CoolPix600 camera while visiting various paleontology collections. The aim of this project is to groundtruth whether smaller image datasets of 100-200 images (as is often an issue in paleontology) can still produce models with adequate accuracy. Using this information, we will examine character (morphology) variations to quantify and detect modes of speciation and paleo-population dynamics for informing how modern horses (*Equus*) originated.
